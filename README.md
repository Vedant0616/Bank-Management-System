# Bank-Management-System
Project for the course Data Structures and Algorithms built using AVL and Linked list

The purpose of a bank management system is to facilitate the easy recording, management, maintenance of a customerâ€™s banking details and to deliver the subsequently required services. These have a broad scope, including the likes of creating a bank account, the deposit and withdrawal of money, checking of account balance, modifying the account details, deletion of bank account, viewing of past transactions, to name a few.

Our project will be built around the structure of an admin and several customers. The admin will have all the authoritative functionalities such as creation, deletion, editing of bank accounts and details. On the other hand, the customer will have functions dealing with withdrawal and deposit of money and viewing his bank details.
The customer will also be able to view the transactions (withdrawals and deposits) made by him, and the admin will be able to view all the transactions made by all customers, searchable by their bank account numbers.

We primarily plan to use data structures such as trees and linked lists; however, basic storage units such as arrays and vectors might be used. The use of other data structures will be decided during the building phase, as required.
